```

In this exercise we try to check the distribution of UroMod SNP 
by different AGE group in CHRIS Study participants!

First we grepped SNPs genotype data from the latest VCF file imputed by TOPMedR2.
One more time!


```{r}
library(pander)
pander(summary(UMOD), style = "rmarkdown", split.tables = 120)
```

Check the contingacy table:

```
tab <- as.matrix(prop.table(table(UMOD$DS_Level, UMOD$Age_cat), margin = 2))
tab[2,]
tab[2,]/2 + tab[3,]

```

```
plot(tab[2,]/2 + tab[3,])
```
